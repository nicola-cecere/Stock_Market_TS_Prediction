# S&P500 Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project applies data mining and time series analysis techniques to forecast S&P500 stock prices. Using a dataset from the S&P500 index, we focus specifically on the Apple stock (AAPL), aiming to predict its closing price based on the previous five days.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization
- Analysis of missing values and outlier detection
- Feature engineering, including seasonality and lag features
- LSTM model development and evaluation
- Exploration of a hybrid CNN-LSTM model

## Results
The LSTM model demonstrated effectiveness in predicting stock prices, showing potential as a tool for financial analysis. A hybrid CNN-LSTM model was also explored but did not significantly outperform the LSTM model.
